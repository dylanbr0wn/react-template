# React Template

This is a barebones [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript project made using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

## Dependencies

To get started all you need is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). This project was generated using v16.9.1, but should work with any version > 16.

## Quickest path to awesome

1. If you havent yet, clone this repo to your machine.

```sh
git clone
```

Once cloned, cd into the folder.

```sh
cd react-template
```

2. Install the dependencies for the project using npm in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Once all dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!

## Some extras

If you are looking to extend this project, here are some of my favourite libraries:

-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [React Spring](https://react-spring.io/)
-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
-   [HeroIcons](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons#react)
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

If you would prefer to create a Typescript project, I would suggest creating a new project with Vite and selecting the `react-ts` option:

```sh
npm create vite@latest
```
